    "In Python, classes and modules are both fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, but they serve different purposes and have different relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python code that can define variables, functions, and classes. It is used to organize and encapsulate related code and data. Modules allow you to reuse code across multiple programs by importing them into other modules or scripts using the import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects of the class will have. Classes provide a way to create and define objects with specific behaviors and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between classes and modules is that classes can be defined within modules. In other words, a module can contain one or more class definitions. The module serves as a container for organizing related classes. This allows you to group related classes together and import them collectively when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could have a module named \"shapes.py\" that contains class definitions for various shapes such as a Circle class, Rectangle class, and Triangle class. Each class definition provides the blueprint for creating objects of that specific shape. By organizing these classes within a module, you can import the module into other scripts or modules and use the defined classes to create shape objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, modules provide a way to organize and package related code, while classes define the structure and behavior of objects. Classes can be defined within modules to group related classes together for better organization and reusability."

Inheritance promotes code reuse and allows you to create a hierarchy of related classes with increasing levels of specialization.
